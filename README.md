# Find-a-Pair

## Find a Pair - a simple CSS + JS game

Press "Start" to begin the game. You see a board with geometric figures.<br>
You have to find two identical figures (the same pattern, shape, rotation type and direction). Click on both to win a round.<br>
Do your best in 55 seconds. Watch the red line (a time counter).<br>
